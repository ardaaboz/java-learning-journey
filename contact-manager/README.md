# Contact Manager

Create a simple contact management program that uses file I/O to:

- Add new contacts
- Display all contacts
- Search for contacts by name

## Requirements

- Use proper exception handling
- Implement try-with-resources for file operations
- Create a menu-driven command-line interface
- Ensure the program can handle missing files gracefully
